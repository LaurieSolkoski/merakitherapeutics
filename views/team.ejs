                <h4 class="owner-title">OWNER & FOUNDER</h4>
                <p>June sources her inspiration from wanting to help others and their bodies achieve a healthy and active lifestyle. This motivation, coupled with her keen interest in the human anatomy, propelled June to pursue the discipline of massage therapy. Too often she had heard of unsatisfied treatments and saw this as an opportunity to flex her passion, while providing knowledgeable treatments and promoting self-care.</p>
                <p>However, an unfortunate car accident in early 2016, injured her hand and rendered her ability to continue massage. While recovering, her curiosity spurred the research and pursuit of a more therapeutic approach to massage while helping people authentically connect, heal, and rejuvenate in a safe holistic environment.</p>
